# biography-corpus

A rule based NLP system that creates a small corpus of sentences indicating birth/death information of people from Wikipedia biography pages. 
All information should be extracted from the text of that wikipedia page, not from the info box on the right.

- place of birth

- year of birth

- place of death (if exists)

- year of death (if exists)
